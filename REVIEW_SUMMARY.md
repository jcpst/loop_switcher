# Code Review Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Updated:** December 16, 2025 (Critical Fixes Merged)  
**Project:** 4-Loop MIDI Switcher  
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Overview

Critical bugs identified in the initial review have been fixed and merged to main. The code uses modular design with clear separation of concerns.

---

## Key Characteristics

1. **Modular Architecture** - Separation between hardware, state, and logic
2. **Organized Structure** - Modules with defined responsibilities  
3. **Documentation** - README with feature descriptions
4. **Hardware Abstraction** - Maintainable interfaces
5. **Timing Implementation** - Debouncing and response times suitable for audio

---

## ✅ Critical Issues - Status

### 1. ✅ EEPROM Wear Leveling - **FIXED**
**File:** `state_manager.cpp`  
**Status:** Merged via PR #6  
**Fix Applied:** Added dirty-check before EEPROM writes
```cpp
void StateManager::savePreset(uint8_t presetNumber) {
    // ... pack state ...
    uint8_t currentValue = EEPROM.read(addr);
    if (currentValue != packedState) {  // Only write if changed
        EEPROM.write(addr, packedState);
    }
}
```

### 2. ✅ MIDI PC Calculation Bug - **FIXED**
**File:** `mode_controller.cpp` lines 154, 190  
**Status:** Merged via PR #4  
**Fix Applied:** Corrected formula to `((state.currentBank - 1) * 4) + switchIndex + 1`

### 3. ⚠️ LED Pin Conflict - Still Present (Low Priority)
**File:** `main.cpp` line 39  
**Issue:** `LED_BUILTIN` (pin 13) may conflict with MAX7219 CLK pin  
**Impact:** Could interfere with display in some configurations  
**Recommendation:** Remove if display issues occur:
```cpp
// Remove this line if needed:
// pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
```

### 3. 🟡 Double-Press Detection (Medium Priority)
**File:** `mode_controller.cpp` line 174  
**Issue:** Global preset activation may not reliably detect quick double-presses  
**Impact:** Users may have difficulty activating global preset  
**Fix:** Implement explicit double-tap detection with timing window

## 📋 Recommended Action Items

### 🔴 Fix Immediately (Before Production Use)
- [ ] Add EEPROM wear protection to `savePreset()`
- [ ] Remove `LED_BUILTIN` pin conflict
- [ ] Add input validation to MIDI handler
- [ ] Fix double-press detection for global preset

### 🟡 Address in Next Update
- [ ] Remember previous mode when exiting channel set mode
- [ ] Implement display buffering to reduce flicker
- [ ] Add fixed loop timing for power efficiency
- [ ] Add debug output with compile-time flag
- [ ] Define constants for magic numbers (NUM_LOOPS, NUM_BANKS, etc.)

### 🟢 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add unit test infrastructure
- [ ] Create state machine diagrams
- [ ] Add hardware schematic to documentation
- [ ] Implement staggered relay switching
- [ ] Add MIDI receive capability
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Quick Wins

Small changes with immediate impact:

1. **Define Constants** (5 min)
   ```cpp
   // Add to config.h:
   const uint8_t NUM_LOOPS = 4;
   const uint8_t NUM_BANKS = 32;
   const uint8_t PRESETS_PER_BANK = 4;
   ```

2. **Add Debug Output** (10 min)
   ```cpp
   #ifdef DEBUG_MODE
   #define DEBUG_PRINT(x) Serial.print(x)
   #else
   #define DEBUG_PRINT(x)
   #endif
   ```

3. **Optimize Loop Timing** (5 min)
   ```cpp
   void loop() {
       static unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;
       if (millis() - lastUpdate < 10) return;  // 100Hz update rate
       lastUpdate = millis();
       // ... rest of loop
   }
   ```

## 📖 Documentation Status

| Item | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| README | ✅ Complete | - |
| Pin Documentation | ✅ Present | - |
| Code Comments | ⚠️ Adequate | Medium |
| State Diagrams | ❌ Missing | Low |
| Schematic | ❌ Missing | Medium |

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

**Current State:** Ready for personal/prototype use  
**Production Ready After:** Fixing 2 high-priority issues (EEPROM + LED conflict)  
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes  

---

## 📞 Questions to Consider

1. **Power Supply:** Are flyback diodes included on relays? (Should document)
2. **Enclosure:** What's the mechanical button debouncing strategy?
3. **Testing:** How are you currently testing the hardware?
4. **Use Case:** Is this for personal use or will others build it?
5. **Future:** Any plans for MIDI input or additional features?

## Summary

The project demonstrates embedded programming and hardware interfacing fundamentals. Issues found are typical for embedded systems. Critical items have been fixed in main branch.

The code is maintainable with a modular architecture.

**Next Steps:**
1. Read the detailed review in `CODE_REVIEW.md`
2. Fix the two high-priority issues
3. Consider the medium-priority improvements for next version
4. Add testing procedures for hardware validation
